1) How would Alice send the message? 	

	Alice would encrypt the message using a piece of software and send it using
	a messaging platform. She would use the RSA encryption formula:
	E = M_1^e mod N
	where E is the encryped message, e and N are based off Bob's public key, Pu(B)
	Alice would encrypt her message using this formula and send it

2) How would Bob decipher the message?
	
	Bob would recieve the message and use the RSA decryption formula:
	D = M_3^d mod N
	where D is the decrypted message, d and N are from Bob's private key, Pr(B)

3)How would Alice send the message?
	
	She wpould encrypt the file using the above encryption formula and send it as normal

4)What would Bob do to verify that the message indeed came from Alice?

	If Bob can decrypt the message using Alice's private key (Pr(A)), the message
	came from her.
